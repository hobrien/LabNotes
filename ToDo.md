- PCA excluding sex chromosomes
- calculate transcript Signal to Noise Ratio by week to look at overall divergence in gene expression
        - sum square of diff between M and F for each gene, then take square root
        - 
- WGCNA 


- Quantify Intronic reads
- Paired analysis

- ASEReadCounter
- rerun what I've done with non-overlapping reads
- 

- how many transcripts can we identify

- 12-14, FDR.05 and .1
- 12-20, FDR.05 and .1

Prepare talk!
- early developmental origin (esp. autism scz)
- MRC funded study primary aim is to relate genetic effects on expression to genetic risk factors in the fetal brain
- largest collection of 2tm brain samples in the world
- 2nd biggest (lieber inst) is about 40 and predominantly and predominantly AA (vs. caucasian for ours)
- HiSeq, 100+ reads
- RNAseq background (genome-wide measure of gene expression)
- Sex differences stuff

- example of ASE from Nicks's paper
