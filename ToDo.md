- PCA excluding sex chromosomes
- calculate transcript Signal to Noise Ratio by week to look at overall divergence in gene expression
        - sum square of diff between M and F for each gene, then take square root
        - 
- WGCNA 
- week by week analyses

- Reread {Pollen:2014ej}, {Darmanis:2015hf}, {Werling:2016jn}, {Wu:2016kh}

- Quantify Intronic reads
- Paired analysis

- ASEReadCounter
- rerun what I've done with non-overlapping reads
- FET on DE genes vs. 

- how many transcripts can we identify

- compare to older gene lists
- compare our list to ones from the literature
- compare sDMPs to our gene sets

Prepare talk!
- early developmental origin (esp. autism scz)
- MRC funded study primary aim is to relate genetic effects on expression to genetic risk factors in the fetal brain
- largest collection of 2tm brain samples in the world
- 2nd biggest (lieber inst) is about 40 and predominantly and predominantly AA (vs. caucasian for ours)
- HiSeq, 100+ reads
- RNAseq background (genome-wide measure of gene expression)
- Sex differences stuff

- example of ASE from Nicks's paper
