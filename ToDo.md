- PCA excluding sex chromosomes
- calculate transcript Signal to Noise Ratio by week to look at overall divergence in gene expression
        - sum square of diff between M and F for each gene, then take square root

- WGCNA 


- Quantify Intronic reads
- Paired analysis

- ASEReadCounter
- rerun what I've done with non-overlapping reads
- 

- how many transcripts can we identify
