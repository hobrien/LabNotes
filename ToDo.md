- PCA at different ages and look at the amount of variance explained by sex
    - calculate transcript Signal to Noise Ratio by week to look at overall divergence in gene expression
        - sum square of diff between M and F for each gene, then take square root
        - 
    - most variable genes and also Pollen et al gene set
- Remove sample with highest Cooks difference
- LRT on age/sex interaction
- WGCNA 
- GSEA using Pollen et al gene sets


- Quantify Intronic reads
- Paired analysis

- ASEReadCounter
- rerun what I've done with non-overlapping reads
- 

- how many transcripts can we identify
